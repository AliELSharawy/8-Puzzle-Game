## Search-Algorithms

### BFS
- Start by checking the shallowest node first,serch level by level and check if it was the goal when dequeueing from queue.
### DFS
- Start by checking the deepest node first, and check if it was the goal when poping from stack.
### A*
- Searching according to the min(Cost(x) + heuristic(x)) using Priority Queue as frontier.The heuristic is calculated using 2 different methods **Manhattan**  and **Euclidean**
